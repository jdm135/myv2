                                <p>MyTV allows you to Revive your favorite shows that have been discontinued by creating petitions to bring these shows back to life. You can also Launch your own show projects on mytv that need further funding to develop
                                    and create, simply share with your fans and gain their support.</p>
                                <p>It also acts as a funding platform for Revive shows that have reached out to us having seen your petitions and are looking for further support, giving the power back to the viewers.</p>

                                <p>Petitions come from you! If you love a show that was discontinued and want to see it back, simply create a Revive Petition and get all of your friends to sign and share it. If it becomes high profile enough with a lot of
                                    signatures the creators will notice it and look in to reviving your favorite show!</p>

                                <p>It provides less risk for everyone. The Launch pages must have realistic but specific goals set to achieve a full project as outlined on their page. Projects generally reach their goal or receive very little support. There
                                    is rarely any in-between.</p>
                                <p>If you set a $10,000 goal and are at $2,000 you already have a lot of people supporting the project. It motivates yourself and those who have backed the project to spread the work to see the project come alive.</p>
                                <p>If your show starts to receive a large amount of support it will appear on our "Rising" or "Trending" pages and this will increase the number of people who see it and therefore the number of people willing to support. The
                                    initial support is super important, so share it as much as you can!</p>
                                <p>No one is charged until a project meets its funding goal and the funding period ends. This gives backers time to evaluate a project and also gives us time to look in to any concerns raised by the backers.</p>

                                <p>Launch projects are created by both us at MyTV and those of you hoping to get funding to create your own shows. We will work alongside those who are partnered with MyTV (10% extra from their cut to be featured etc.) to

                                <p>The fees are there to allow us to keep improving the site at very little cost to the backers and the creators. The percentage we take goes towards creating an efficient and effective way for communities to grow and support

                            <h4>Who is responsible for completing a Launched project?</h4>
                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>The Launch creator is responsible for completing their project. MyTV is not involved in the development.</p>
                                <p>We do not guarantee projects or investigate a creator's ability to complete their project. You the fans have the power to decide the validity of a project and its worthiness to be funded.</p>

                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>Successful projects will become very popular and closely followed. The creators are putting their reputation and brands and risk if they do not follow through.</p>
                                <p>You should look for the creators who have a clear plan, show experience, have evidence of their work and previous creative ventures. Make an informed decision on the projects you choose to support.</p>
                                <p>Check for social media connections such as posts on their pages that link directly to their Launch page to make sure that it is them. Feel free to request information from a creator via the "Contact me" button on their
                                    Launch page.</p>

                                <p>You may be friends with the creator or have heard about the Launch from a trusted source.</p>
                                <p>Look at their content, check that their social media pages support their Launch project. Make sure they have created content previously. Send them a message to request more information via the "Contact me" button on their
                                    Launch page.</p>
                                <p>In the creator's content bio, you will be able to see their social media links and other information. You will also find verified accounts which have a check mark next to it.</p>

                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>If you are having issues, the best thing to do is be transparent. Let the people supporting your project know what is happening by creating posts on the Updates section of your Launch page.</p>
                                <p>People will generally be very understanding as we all know things very rarely go exactly to plan and can take longer than expected. Often execution to create the best content will take longer than originally expected, this
                                    is to the backer's benefit, although there may be a delay, the project may be even better than they had hoped.</p>
                                <p>If the problems are severe, you the creator will have to find a resolution. Such as offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used and other actions to satisfy backers. For more information, see our <a href="/termsofuse.php">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

                                <p>The creator is responsible for completing the project and fulfilling each of their outlined rewards. Remember â€“ MyTV isn't a shop, we are not selling finished content, we simply provide an avenue for fans to help create
                                    something new. It is down to the creator to fulfill or resolve any issues that may arise. Each Launch becomes its own little community, discuss issues and be transparent with each other. For more information, see our

                                <p>No, MyTV doesn't issue refunds. All transactions are between backers and the Launch creators directly. Creators receive all funds (less fees) soon after their campaign ends.</p>

                                <p>MyTV is a platform for people to express their love of old shows and show support to new creative ideas. You no longer need to make your way up the corporate ladder to become a TV writer for a massive network, you can show
                                    your talents on MyTV and prove to the world that they've been missing something fantastic.</p>
                                <p>This does however mean that because we open the doors to all the wonderful, ambitious and genius ideas, many of the projects you see on MyTV are in the very early stages of development. There is a risk that projects can
                                    fail or not be up to the standard you had hoped, but that is out of our control, we simply provide the platform that combines creativity and support.</p>

                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>We are dedicated to monitoring suspicious activity. We keep an eye out at all times, but the report button often helps us to pinpoint issues that do not align with our rules. So if you notice anything suspicious do not
                                    hesitate to report it.</p>
                                <p>Remember, no one is charged until a project meets its funding goal and the funding period ends. This gives backers time to evaluate a project and also gives us time to look in to any concerns raised by the backers.</p>
